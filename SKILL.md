# posterly — HTML/CSS Academic Poster Workflow

A poster is **one HTML file** styled for an exact print canvas, rendered to PDF via Playwright + Chromium. Iterate by **measuring**, not eyeballing — the screen preview lies; only `emulate_media("print")` at the correct viewport tells the truth.

## Mental model

```
   HTML (with @page { size: W H })
     │
     ▼  print-emulate Chromium at W×96 × H×96 px viewport
     │
     ▼  data-measure-role tags identify columns/hero/footer-strip
     │
     ├──→ tools/poster_check.py measure  (HARD GATE — spread < 5 px,
     │                                    gap-to-strip ∈ [30,50] px,
     │                                    poster bbox aligns to page
     │                                    within ±2 px)
     ├──→ tools/poster_check.py preflight  (LaTeX residue, math `<`, missing imgs)
     ├──→ tools/render_preview.py  (PDF + thumbnail)
     └──→ tools/poster_check.py verify-final  (PDF page count / dims / size)
```

The skill is venue- and lab-neutral by default. Pick a template from `templates/README.md`, edit `:root` design tokens for your colors, fill TODO placeholders with your paper's content.

## Canvas constants

| Constant | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--u` (CSS unit) | print = `1mm`, screen = `1.6px` | Use `calc(N * var(--u))` for ALL sizing. |
| Print viewport (px) | `W_in × 96` × `H_in × 96` | Computed by `poster_check`/`render_preview`. |
| Body cols | 2 / 3 / 4, or 1 hero + 1 column | Per template. |
| Strict alignment | **spread < 5 px** (aim < 3) | Hard, non-negotiable gate. |

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Pull the venue's official poster guidelines

Conference specs change year-to-year and vary wildly between venues:

- ICML often goes 60×36 in landscape; **ICLR has been 24×36 in portrait** in recent years; **NeurIPS** historically allowed multiple sizes; **CVPR** has used A0 portrait. Don't assume.
- Font minimums (≥24pt body for some venues), bleed margins, allowed orientations, on-poster logos, anonymity rules, QR-code policies — all vary.

Procedure:
1. `WebSearch` for `"<venue> <year> poster instructions"` or `"<venue> <year> poster size"`.
2. `WebFetch` the venue's official page; extract **dimensions, orientation, font-size floor, logo policy, anonymity rules, file-format requirement, template link if any**.
3. If paywalled or down, check OpenReview's call-for-papers or ask the user for the relevant section.
4. Echo the extracted spec back to the user in one short table **BEFORE** drafting. Confirm before proceeding — a wrong canvas size invalidates every alignment decision downstream.

### Step 0.5 — Design discovery (one round of AskUserQuestion)

Don't pick a template silently. Ask the user, in one batch:

- **Layout**: "Which gallery template fits best? (a) 4-column landscape, (b) hero + supporting column landscape, (c) 2-column portrait." Show them `templates/README.md`'s table.
- **Palette**: "Lab/venue colors? E.g. `#XXX` accent + `#YYY` highlight. Default = neutral slate-blue + gold."
- **Logos**: "Which logos to include? Paths or URLs."
- **Corresponding-author marker**: "Which author gets `✉`? Any starred (`★`) co-authors?"

Persist the user's answers as you go — re-reading them later prevents "improvement" loops that revert deliberate decisions.

### Step 1 — Confirm content & figures

Once layout is picked, ask once:
- **Source paper** path (`paper-overleaf/.../main.tex` ideal). Read the abstract, intro, headline results. Don't draft from memory — pull actual numbers, dataset names, equations.
- **Figures**: match `images/` filenames to paper figures.
- **Items to preserve/exclude**: which sections to drop, any "do not revert" notes.

### Step 1.5 — Content audit (strongly recommended)

Before laying out, the draft must be audited for paper-to-poster fidelity. Past sessions caught real bugs ONLY here — paper said "20× fewer" but the table gave 16×, "fewest trajectories" was an overclaim vs the actual baselines, theorem preconditions were silently dropped. Skip this and you will discover errors only when standing next to the printed poster.

**How to run it (in order of preference):**

1. **External LLM reviewer with file access (best).** If you have Codex MCP, GPT-5 with file access, another Claude session, or any reviewer that can `Read` paper source files, use that. Recommended defaults if you have Codex MCP: `model="gpt-5.5"`, `model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"`, `sandbox="danger-full-access"` (read-only audit). Send the evidence pack + reviewer prompt below.

2. **Self-audit (fallback).** Walk every numeric claim on the poster and find its `file:line` in the paper source. Build the claim → evidence table by hand. Slower, easier to miss things, but better than skipping.

**Evidence pack the reviewer needs:**
1. The current `poster.html` (full)
2. Paper source path(s) so the reviewer can `Read` the `.tex` and any `results/` CSVs
3. For every numeric claim, the paper `file:line` where the number originates
4. For every theorem/claim, the paper statement verbatim with all preconditions

**Reviewer prompt template** (use this verbatim, fill bracketed parts):

```
Audit the academic-poster draft at [poster.html abs path] against the paper at [main.tex abs path] (and any results in [results dir]). For every number, claim, theorem, dataset name, and method-comparison on the poster, produce a claim → evidence table:

  | claim on poster | paper file:line | paper says (verbatim) | match? |

Mark "match?" as: OK / NUMERIC-MISMATCH / OVERCLAIM / MISSING-PRECONDITION / NOT-IN-PAPER / SCOPE-NARROWED.

Then list every NON-OK row as a problem to fix before printing. Be skeptical — "all <method> methods" claims, "best by Nx" claims, and theorem statements without their epsilon/regularity preconditions are the most common silent errors.
```

You may proceed to Step 2 **only after every finding is either fixed or explicitly recorded as "user-acknowledged tradeoff"**. Do not silently defer.

### Step 2 — Image preprocessing (optional but reduces re-renders)

For each paper figure you'll use:

1. **Autocrop whitespace** with PIL.ImageChops so the figure fills its card.
2. **Re-export at ≥ 2× the rendered px**. A `200u × 120u` figure print-rendered at 96 ppi → ~756 × 454 px. Source PNGs must be ≥ 1500 × 900 to look crisp at print.
3. **QR codes**: request at ≥ 2× rendered px (e.g., 480×480 if displayed at ~240 px).

### Step 3 — Scaffold from the gallery

1. `cp templates/<chosen>.html <work-dir>/poster.html`.
2. Edit the `:root` design tokens (single block; affects everything).
3. Replace `<title>`, header (title/subtitle/authors/affiliation), banner (if any), column cards, takeaways strip (if any), footer.
4. Match the template's `data-measure-role` scheme — DO NOT remove these attributes. The measurement script depends on them.

A gallery template is a **scaffold**: it passes `preflight` (structure) as shipped, but with figures commented out and copy as `TODO` stubs it is **expected to fail `measure`/`polish`** (columns only fill the top, so the column-bottom spread and gap-to-footer are far out of band). Those two gates judge a *filled* poster — they go green only after Steps 4–6 below, once you've added real content and balanced the columns. Don't try to "fix" a fresh scaffold to pass `measure`; fill it first.

Tools live in `tools/` and read `@page` from the HTML, so they're canvas-agnostic — the same commands work for ICLR portrait and ICML landscape.

### Step 4 — Render + measure loop (HARD GATE)

```bash
# After every layout change:
python <skill>/tools/poster_check.py measure poster.html
```

Targets (defaults; configurable via flags):
- **`spread < 5 px`** across the last-card-bottoms of all columns (+ any hero panel). Aim `< 3 px`.
- **`gap to footer-strip/footer ∈ [30, 50] px`** — card shadow visible but cards don't float.
- **`position align ≤ 2 px`** (authoritative) — the `[data-measure-role="poster"]` bounding box must sit at `(0, 0)` to `(viewport_w, viewport_h)` within `--position-tol-px`. This IS the full-canvas requirement: a poster whose bbox aligns to the page is necessarily full-bleed. Catches `transform: translate*`, mis-positioned `position: absolute`, stray body margin in print, and CSS source-order cascade bugs where a screen rule wins over a print override.
- **`canvas-fill ∈ [95 %, 101 %]`** (coarse early diagnostic) — `[data-measure-role="poster"]` width/height ratio against the print viewport. Fires before the position check when the ratio is FAR off, with a more diagnostic error message that points at the common `@media print { :root { --u: 1mm } }` omission (renders at ~42 %) or hardcoded `width > @page` (renders at >100 %). For borderline 95–99 % cases, position-align is the truth. Tune via `--min-canvas-fill` / `--max-canvas-fill`. **Safe-area design** belongs as internal padding on a full-bleed `.poster`, NOT as a smaller poster — a smaller poster fails position-align.

**This gate is non-negotiable.** If `measure` exits non-zero, fix the layout — do NOT continue to render. Common fixes:
- spread > 5: shrink the column with the lowest last-card by reducing a paragraph's `margin-bottom` by 1u, trimming one line, or shrinking a fixed-height figure by 5u.
- gap > 50 everywhere: body-grid is too tall; grow a card or accept whitespace.
- gap < 30 anywhere: banner/header outgrew its slot; check `.framework-banner` rendered height.
- position misaligned (the usual full-canvas failure): make `.poster` full-bleed (`width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0` in `@media print`); remove any `transform: translate*` or `position: absolute` offsets; ensure `html, body { margin: 0; padding: 0 }` in the print media query; and check that the print `@media` block comes AFTER the screen `.poster` rule so source-order cascade resolves the print override winning.
- canvas-fill < 95 % (diagnostic fired first): poster forgot `@media print { :root { --u: 1mm } }` so it renders at screen scale. Add the override.
- canvas-fill > 101 % (diagnostic fired first): hardcoded `width: 1600px` (or similar non-`--u`-based size) exceeds `@page`. Replace with `calc(N * var(--u))`.

`poster_check.py measure` also has these safety nets (so a false PASS shouldn't happen):
- Missing `[data-measure-role="poster"]` = hard fail.
- Empty columns = hard fail (override: `--allow-empty-column`).
- Missing footer-strip AND footer = hard fail (override: `--allow-no-footer-gap`).
- MathJax intended (a `<script src="…mathjax…">` tag or `window.MathJax` config is present) but no `<mjx-container>` rendered, while TeX delimiters (`$…$` / `$$…$$` / `\(…\)` / `\[…\]`) remain in body text = hard fail (CDN block, script error). A page that just *describes* TeX syntax in prose without ever loading MathJax is NOT failed.
- MathJax typeset timeout = hard fail (override: `--mathjax-timeout-ms`).
- `@page` size missing AND no `--canvas` override = exit 2.

Run preflight in parallel:

```bash
python <skill>/tools/poster_check.py preflight poster.html
```

Catches: LaTeX residue (`\ref{`, `\cite{`, `\textbf{`, lone `\ `), bare `<` inside `$…$` math (MathJax mis-parses as HTML tag), missing local images, missing `data-measure-role="poster"`, unknown role values.

### Step 5 — Render + visual inspection

```bash
python <skill>/tools/render_preview.py poster.html
pdftoppm -r 100 poster_preview.pdf poster_check -png -f 1 -l 1
# then Read the resulting PNG
```

For dense regions, crop with PIL and read the slice — full poster at r=100 is ~6000 px wide; useful regions (header, banner, takeaways, one column) at full res reveal text wrapping issues invisible in the thumbnail.

### Step 6 — Polish

After alignment is solid, run the **visual polish gate**:

```bash
python <skill>/tools/poster_check.py polish poster.html
```

This is a **soft** gate (exits 0 by default; pass `--strict` to fail on warnings). It surfaces three failure modes that the hard alignment gate cannot see — figure sizing relative to its aspect ratio, typography orphans, and column whitespace pretending to be balance. See **§Visual polish gates** below for the rule for each WARN class and the correct fix. Fix every WARN unless you explicitly judge it acceptable for this poster.

Other polish:
- **`text-wrap: balance`** on banner/takeaways prose — fixes ragged-right and single-word-orphan lines.
- Match QR visual height to adjacent institutional logo (same `--u` value).

**Step 6.5 — Final review (strongly recommended)**: send the rendered PDF (or its high-res PNG slices) AND the HTML to the same kind of reviewer used in Step 1.5 (external LLM if available, self-audit otherwise). Same evidence-pack rule. The reviewer prompt focuses on three things distinct from Step 1.5:
1. **Visual rhetoric**: does the poster's narrative carry? Are the headline numbers prominent? Is the framework banner readable from 2 m?
2. **Residue**: any `\ref{`, `\cite{`, leftover `TODO`, raw `<` in math, missing image, broken QR link.
3. **Final claim audit**: re-check numbers and overclaims AFTER content has been polished — polish often introduces new claims ("a key advantage of…") that were not in the original draft.

Fix every finding before declaring the poster done.

### Step 7 — Final verification

```bash
python <skill>/tools/poster_check.py verify-final poster_preview.pdf \
    --canvas 60x36in --max-size-mb 20
# or read the expected canvas from the companion HTML:
python <skill>/tools/poster_check.py verify-final poster_preview.pdf \
    --from-html poster.html
```

Checks: page count == 1, dimensions match canvas, file size ≤ limit. `--canvas` accepts inch dimensions (`60x36in`) or named sizes (`A0 portrait`, `A1 landscape`). By default rejects swapped W/H unless the PDF declares `Page rot ∈ {90, 270}` or you pass `--allow-rotated`. `--from-html <path>` reads `@page { size: … }` from the HTML so they can't drift apart.

Then report to the user:
- File path of PDF
- Final spread (px) and gap-to-footer range
- Any unresolved Codex feedback
- Page-fit confirmation

## Visual polish gates (Step 6 — soft gate)

Alignment passes but the poster can still look amateur. These three failure modes recurred across sessions enough to be promoted to first-class checks. `tools/poster_check.py polish` surfaces each as a WARN; the rules below explain how to fix.

### Gate A — Figure sizing by aspect ratio

A figure too small for its column is more wasteful than one too big. Pick width by the figure's intrinsic aspect ratio (`AR = naturalWidth / naturalHeight`), NOT by a fixed default:

| AR range | Shape | Aim for | `polish` warns below / above |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AR > 1.3` | Wide (workflow diagram, comparison chart) | **70–100%** of card width | < **65%** ⇒ FIG/WIDE. Avoid image-left/text-right in a narrow column — text gets squeezed to nothing (deliberate, balanced exception: the `data-fig-layout="beside-text"` opt-out below). |
| `0.8 ≤ AR ≤ 1.3` | Square-ish (block diagram, scatter) | **55–75%** of card width | < **55%** ⇒ FIG/SQUARE. |
| `AR < 0.8` | Tall (multi-series bar, long pipeline) | **45–60%**, paired with **text-right** | > **70%** at full width ⇒ FIG/TALL (recommends side text). |

Thresholds are tunable via `--wide-min-ratio` / `--square-min-ratio` / `--tall-max-ratio`. The defaults are the "aim for" lower bound, so anything inside the documented "aim for" range passes the gate cleanly.

A figure whose `<img>` fails to load (missing file, 404, or unreachable remote URL) reports zero natural size and warns as **FIG/BROKEN** — it will be blank in print. SVGs are exempt (they legitimately report zero intrinsic size). The probe covers both card and hero-panel `<img>` (the hero centerpiece is the worst image to silently lose); the AR sizing gates stay card-only. One known gap: an SVG served from an extensionless URL still slips through the exemption heuristic.

Concrete bad case (prior session): `co-consideration.png` (AR ≈ 1.41) shipped at 41 % column width. The whitespace beside it conveyed nothing and the figure was unreadable from 2 m. Fix: 66 % width, no text-right.

**Deliberate image-left/text-right (the opt-out).** FIG/WIDE fires on a wide figure sized below 65 % because the *usual* cause is the bad case above — a figure shrunk into a gray margin. But a wide figure that **shares its card with a meaningful text column** (figure left, explanatory annotations right) is a legitimate layout when the text genuinely earns its space and isn't squeezed to a sliver. For that case, mark the `<img>` with `data-fig-layout="beside-text"`:

```html
<img src="images/dynamics.png" alt="Training dynamics"
     data-fig-layout="beside-text" style="width: 100%">
```

This skips the AR width gates (FIG/WIDE / FIG/SQUARE / FIG/TALL) for that image only — **FIG/BROKEN still applies** (a blank image is a bug regardless of intent). The attribute records the design decision *in the markup*, so a later edit (human or agent) reads "this figure is intentionally beside text" and leaves the layout alone instead of widening it to silence the warning. Use it only after you've eyeballed the render and confirmed the text column isn't squeezed — it is an opt-out for a *verified-good* layout, not a way to mute a real warning. `examples/powerflow_icml2026/poster.html` uses it on its training-dynamics card.

### Gate B — Typography orphans

`measure` checks card bottoms; it does NOT see a `↑` or superscript that wrapped alone onto its own line — a small but jarring artifact 2 m away.

Known orphan-prone patterns:
- Stat numbers with trailing arrows: `1.18–1.30× ↑`, `18.24% ↓`
- Number + unit / multiplier: `4096 × 4096`, `7 nm`, `2248×`
- Trailing footnote markers: `BraVE*`, `MEAN§`

Defenses (preferred → fallback):

1. **`white-space: nowrap`** on the smallest element whose innerText must stay one line (`.stat-num`, `.hs-stat .num`, `.takeaway-num`). Blanket — text simply does not break.
2. **Non-breaking glue** between the last two tokens: `1.18–1.30×&nbsp;↑`. Use when nowrap would overflow a tight card.
3. **Reword to put the marker first**: `↑ 1.18–1.30× speedup` — arrow becomes the line's first token, can't orphan.

`polish` flags an element (`[class*="stat"], [class*="num"], .takeaway-num, .hs-stat, .headline-num`) only when its text **ends with a whitespace-separated trailing glyph** from `↑↓↔×÷±§¶†‡*°%` and lacks `white-space: nowrap` — i.e. a lone glyph token that could wrap by itself, like `1.18–1.30× ↑` or `18.24% ↓`. It does **not** catch fused forms such as `4096 × 4096`, `7 nm`, `2248×`, `BraVE*`, or `MEAN§` (the text doesn't end on a space-separated glyph) — guard those by hand with the defenses above.

### Gate C — Content-driven balance, not space-between-driven

`justify-content: space-between` on a column is a shortcut to bottom-align last cards across columns. It works ONLY when the cards' natural heights are within ~5% of each other. When they aren't, space-between fills the delta with empty pixels — usually one giant gap in the column with the smallest content.

**Symptom**: a column with one short card followed by 25 + mm of whitespace. Reads as "this column ran out of things to say".

**Wrong fix**: shrink `gap` globally to hide the whitespace. Peers still have meaningful internal gaps; reducing them makes the others claustrophobic.

**Right fix**: ADD MEANINGFUL CONTENT to the short column until it's within ~5 % of its peers' natural height. From the paper, recover:
- Sub-claims that were footnotes or implicit assumptions
- A 2–3 bullet "challenges" or "design choices" recap
- A short caption beside a previously-bare figure

Concrete bad case (prior session): the SnipSnap Motivation column shipped with a one-line "three challenges" summary, leaving a 13 mm space-between gap. Fix: expanded into 3 bullets matching the paper's challenge framing — column balanced via content, not whitespace.

`polish` warns when a column with computed `justify-content: space-between` has an inter-card gap exceeding 5 % of the column's height (i.e., space-between is doing more work than the column gap CSS suggests). Tune via `--max-space-between-fill`.

**The same trap, one card.** A single card set to `flex: 1` (the standard way to make its column reach the footer and satisfy `measure`'s spread/gap gates) is measured only by its **bottom edge** — a card stretched to twice its content's height passes `measure` with spread = 0 while the lower half is blank white. `measure` can't catch it (it checks only the bottom edge), so **`polish` does**: the **CARD/TRAILING** warning fires when a card leaves more than `--max-card-trailing` (default 10 %) of its height blank below its last line of content. A green bottom-edge gate is necessary, not sufficient. Never stretch a block to create whitespace just to make the layout "fit." Fix it the same way as Gate C, in order of preference: (1) fill the card with real content from the paper until it is comfortably full (aim ≥ ~80 %, not 46 %); (2) enlarge a fixed-height figure to carry the space with substance; (3) if the content genuinely is that sparse, choose a **smaller canvas** so it fills — a single paragraph does not belong on a 60-inch sheet. A half-empty card reads as "ran out of things to say" and is a failed poster even when every gate is green.

## Universal pitfalls (apply to all templates)

1. **`<` raw in MathJax inline** → may be HTML-parsed before MathJax sees it (mode-dependent). Prefer `\lt` everywhere. Preflight catches `(?<!\\)<(?![=/!])` inside `$…$` / `$$…$$` / `\(…\)` / `\[…\]` — i.e. raw `<` NOT preceded by a backslash and NOT followed by `=` / `/` / `!`. The `<=` case is intentionally exempt (single MathJax token, parsed atomically — no HTML-tokenizer ambiguity); preflight stays quiet about it, but `\le` reads more naturally in print.
2. **`\ ` (backslash-space) from LaTeX** → renders literally. Strip when porting from `.tex`. Preflight catches.
3. **Screen-mode measurement is misleading.** Always use `tools/poster_check.py measure` — never eyeball the screen render.
4. **Pre-compact `\\ ` and lone `<`** — preflight catches before render.
5. **`text-wrap: balance` needs Chromium ≥ 114** — Playwright's bundled Chromium is fine.

## Layout-shared pitfalls (column-based templates)

6. **`overflow: hidden` on `.body-grid` clips card shadows.** If last card sits at body-grid bottom, its 30-px shadow is cut and visually merges into the strip below.
7. **`padding-bottom` on `.column` does NOT push cards down.** Cards stack from top in flex; padding-bottom only reserves space. To shrink, edit card content directly.
8. **Title-block can dominate header height.** Shrinking logos/QR doesn't help if `.title-block` is already the tallest cell.
9. **Banner can grow from `.banner-stats`.** Big numbers cascade into body-grid shrinkage.
10. **`box-shadow: 0 2u 6u` extends ~30 px** below the card. Final last-card-bottom must be ≥ 30 px above the strip below.
11. **Image-left + text-right inside a narrow column wastes the image.** For wide images in narrow cols, keep image-on-top + caption-below.

## When to call an external LLM reviewer (three checkpoints)

The skill works fine without one, but a second pair of eyes reliably catches paper-to-poster fidelity bugs you'll otherwise discover next to the print station. Three natural checkpoints:

1. **Content critique** (Step 1.5) — does the poster's prose / numbers / claims match the paper?
2. **Theorem & equation pass** (after Step 3) — are theorem preconditions complete? Equations rendered correctly?
3. **Final polish** (Step 6.5) — fresh eyes on the assembled poster for residue and overclaims.

The bias is **send when uncertain**. Cost: 2-3 min. Cost of a silent error in a poster you'll print and stand next to for 2 hours: high.

**Recommended reviewer settings (if you have Codex MCP):** `model="gpt-5.5"`, `model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"`, `sandbox="danger-full-access"` (read-only review; the sandbox often fails to start in containers / nested namespaces and the audit is read-only anyway). Any other capable reviewer LLM that can `Read` paper files works equally well — see Step 1.5 for the canonical prompt template.

## Tools

```
tools/
├── poster_check.py   ← CLI: measure / preflight / polish / verify-final
├── render_preview.py ← CLI: print-emulated PDF + thumbnail PNG
└── _posterly/        ← internal modules (canvas parser, Playwright + settle, etc.)
```

- `poster_check.py`:
  - `measure` — **hard** alignment gate (column-bottom spread < 5 px, gap-to-footer in [30, 50] px, canvas-fill ∈ [95 %, 101 %] as a coarse diagnostic, and poster bbox aligns to the page within ±2 px — the bbox-alignment check is the authoritative full-canvas requirement).
  - `preflight` — static HTML lint (LaTeX residue, math `<`, missing images, role validation).
  - `polish` — **soft** visual gate (figure sizing by AR, broken images, typography orphans, space-between fill). Warns by default; `--strict` to fail. Hard-fails if the poster has no `[data-measure-role]` markup at all (silent PASS would be a worse bug).
  - `verify-final` — `pdfinfo`-based PDF sanity (page count, dimensions, file size).
- `render_preview.py` — Playwright print-emulated PDF + scaled PNG thumbnail.

All scripts read `@page { size: W H }` from the input HTML so the same code handles ICML 60×36 landscape, ICLR 24×36 portrait, CVPR A0, etc. without flags.

## Templates

See `templates/README.md` for the gallery. Current set:
- `landscape_4col_neutral.html` (60×36 in, 4 cols)
- `landscape_hero_neutral.html` (60×36 in, hero + supporting col)
- `portrait_2col_neutral.html` (24×36 in, 2 cols)

Adding a template: keep it neutral (no lab branding), preserve `data-measure-role` scheme, document the row in `templates/README.md`.

## Key rules

- **Never invent paper numbers.** Read the `.tex` source. Bench numbers, datasets, model names — all verifiable.
- **Card-shadow visibility is non-negotiable.** A poster looks cheap when shadows are clipped.
- **Strict alignment is non-negotiable.** Spread < 5 px or it's not done — do not report success until `measure` exits 0.
- **Preserve user-judgment decisions across sessions.** "Do not revert" notes (`✉ stays on Author X`, `α-sensitivity card removed`) — re-read the user's prior messages before "improving" a section.
